  Users are advised to take caution and good judgement before
  clicking any shortened urls published on social media platforms
  by this website and its owners. Despite the best efforts to ensure
  only genuine urls are published many social media platforms are
  prone to spam and hacking and therefore this website and its owners
  cannot be held liable for any damages or implications caused by visiting
  any shortened links.
